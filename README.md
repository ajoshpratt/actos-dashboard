Actos Dashboard
===============

Actos Dashboard is a QML KWin Script that manages windows, activities and starts applications.

It is inspired by Gnome Shell's Activities view.

## Installation

	plasmapkg --type kwinscript -i .

## Activation

You can enable or disable the plugin, after installation, using *System Settings*, under *Window Behaviour â€º KWin Scripts*.

## Usage

After installing the script and activating it, it will display an icon in the top-left corner of your screen. When the icon is clicked, or when you push the cursor in the top-left corner, the Dashboard will appear, minimizing all open windows and covering the entire screen. 

You can also open the Dashboard using the `Meta + A` keyboard shortcut.

Once the Dashboard is open, you will see three main icons in the left side of the screen representing *Windows*, *Applications* and *Activities*. When searching by typing text in the top-right search box, a fourth category, *Search*, will appear, where you can see the various search results.
